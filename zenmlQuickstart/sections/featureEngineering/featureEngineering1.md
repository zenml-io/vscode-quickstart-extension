Here's a pipeline that brings together several steps (`data_loader`, `data_preprocessor`, and `data_splitter`). As you can see, this pipeline is just another function that has the `@pipeline` decorator added. This specific pipeline doesn't return a value, but that option is available to you if you need.

Click the `run code` button above to run the pipeline.

  <p>
    If you want to view your pipeline runs in the ZenML Dashboard but aren't 
    using ZenML Pro, you can run a local version of the 
    dashboard by running <code>zenml up</code> in the terminal or clicking 
    the button below.

    If you are running this quickstart in codespaces, you'll get a pop-up in 
    the bottom right corner when your dashboard is ready. Follow the link to 
    open the dashboard in a new tab.

  <p>
    Otherwise, VSCode may open the browser tab automatically.

    Log into the Dashboard using default credentials (username <code>default</code>
    and password left blank) and follow the short onboarding flow.
    From there you can inspect the pipeline or the 
    specific pipeline run.
