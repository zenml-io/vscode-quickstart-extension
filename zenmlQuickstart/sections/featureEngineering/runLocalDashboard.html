  <p>
    If you aren't using ZenML Cloud, but are interested in viewing your pipeline 
    runs in the ZenML Dashboard you can run a local version of the 
    dashboard by running <code>zenml up</code> in the terminal or clicking 
    the button below.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are running this quickstart in codespaces, you'll get a pop-up in 
    the bottom right corner when your dashboard is ready. Follow the link to 
    open the dashboard in a new tab. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Otherwise, VSCode may open the browser tab automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    Log into the Dashboard using default credentials (username 'default' 
    and password left blank) and follow the short onboarding flow.
    From there you can inspect the pipeline or the 
    specific pipeline run.
