# Connecting to ZenML Pro ðŸ”Œ

Nice! You just ran your first ZenML pipeline while connected to a deployed ZenML
Pro instance.

This pipeline doesn't actually do much beyond pass values between the two steps,
but it should give you a high-level overview of the basics of how to write a
pipeline:

- Steps are basically just Python functions decorated with a `@step` decorator
- Pipelines are also functions, but decorated with a `@pipeline` decorator
- You add [type hints](https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/build-pipelines/step-output-typing-and-annotation) to the step functions to help ZenML understand and track the inputs and outputs of each step

Now it's time to get into a more complex pipeline where we actually do some
machine learning!
