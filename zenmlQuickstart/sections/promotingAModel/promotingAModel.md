# Promoting our Better Model to Production 🥇

You can do this by simply setting the `stage` of
your chosen model version to the `production` tag.

Of course, normally one would only promote the model by comparing to all other model
versions and doing some other tests. But that's a bit more advanced use-case. See the
[e2e_batch example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/e2e) to get
more insight into that sort of flow!
