# Welcome to the ZenML Quickstart Guide 👋

This VSCode extension running in Codespaces (or locally using a Dev Container!) gives you a sandboxed place to explore using ZenML.

This repository is a minimalistic MLOps project intended as a starting point to learn how to put ML workflows in production. It features:

- A feature engineering pipeline that loads data and prepares it for training.
- A training pipeline that loads the preprocessed dataset and trains a model.
- A batch inference pipeline that runs predictions on the trained model with new data.

Follow along by clicking the 'Run code' and 'Next' buttons as appropriate to understand how you can use ZenML to productionalize your ML workflows!

Try running the code by clicking the `run code` button in the top right corner of this panel.
